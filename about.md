excerpt: "We're here to level the playing field for digital content creators"

Modern digital creative activities are expensive to get into and require collaboration with other skilled individuals.
For independent digital creatives, wouldn't it be great to have a dedicated collaborative space that didn't cost an arm and a leg?

We don't believe that the equipment, software, and relationships needed for modern digital creation should be locked to major studios or firms.
Many creatives choose to pursue their own artistic vision instead of building someone else's. 
Unfortunately, when they're just starting out they may find their ambitions limited by the type of equipment and software they can afford, lack of relationships with publishers, or difficulty finding other skilled and / or motivated people to collaborate with.

We're working on building that kind of place for you.
Our goal is to provide the basic equipment and resources necessary to get started.
We want to build a home base for independent digital artists, engineers, and architects.
We hope that this will become a place that you can find the resources and collaborators to take your creative endeavors further, faster.
